# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Author:  Cherie Bardsley  
Date:  March 8, 2018  


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.


## Requirements
1.  A tidy data set
2.  A link to a Github repository with an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:  
    a.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set  
    b.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement  
    c.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
    d.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names  
    e.  From the data set in step d, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject   
3.  A code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, data and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data  
4.  A README.md in the repo with the scripts  
5.  The repo should explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected  


## Description of the Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
